# Create Product Dialog: UX Analysis & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

The current Create Product dialog suffers from information overload, confusing pricing input, and lacks progressive disclosure. This analysis provides recommendations to transform it into a user-friendly, multi-step experience following modern UX principles.

## Current UX Issues

### 1. Information Overload

- **Problem**: 9+ form fields presented simultaneously on one screen
- **Impact**: Cognitive overload, increased abandonment rates, user confusion
- **Evidence**: All fields visible at once creates a "wall of forms" anti-pattern

### 2. Pricing Input Confusion

- **Problem**: Asking for "pennies" instead of standard currency format
- **Impact**: Mental math burden, input errors, poor user experience
- **Evidence**: Users think in $19.99, not 1999 pennies

### 3. Complex Wallet Management

- **Problem**: Tabs for existing vs new wallets add unnecessary complexity
- **Impact**: Decision paralysis, unclear workflow for new users
- **Evidence**: Tab switching interrupts natural form flow

### 4. No Clear Progression

- **Problem**: No indication of steps or progress through the creation process
- **Impact**: Users don't understand where they are or what's next
- **Evidence**: Single-step forms lack sense of accomplishment

### 5. Limited Contextual Guidance

- **Problem**: Technical fields like "product tokens" lack explanation
- a product token is just the token that is allowed to be used on that network for that product. the token that the customer will potentially pay with
- **Impact**: User confusion, incorrect selections, support burden
- **Evidence**: Terms like "Accepted Token Options" are crypto-native, not user-friendly, user friendlyness is key

### 6. No Preview or Validation

- **Problem**: No way to review the product before creation
- **Impact**: Errors discovered post-creation, poor confidence in system
- **Evidence**: No "what you're creating" summary

## Recommended Multi-Step Approach

### Step 1: Product Basics üéØ

**Goal**: Establish the core product identity

- **Fields**: Name, Description, Product Image (optional)
- **UX Focus**: Simple, confidence-building start
- **Validation**: Real-time name availability, character limits
- **Progress**: "Step 1 of 4" indicator

### Step 2: Pricing & Billing üí∞

**Goal**: Configure how customers will pay

- **Dynamic Currency Selection**: Choose currency first, then price
- **Smart Price Input**:
  - Input in natural format ($19.99, ‚Ç¨25.50)
  - Auto-conversion to backend pennies format
  - Real-time preview of what customers see
- **Product Type Selection**: One-time vs Subscription
- **Conditional Fields**: Show billing intervals only for subscriptions
- **Visual Aids**: Pricing preview card showing customer view
- remember to handle currency dynamically.

### Step 3: Payment Methods üîó

**Goal**: Define what tokens/networks customers can use

- **Simplified Language**: "Payment Options" instead of "Product Tokens"
- **Visual Network Selector**: Cards with network logos and names
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-select popular networks (Ethereum, Polygon)
- **Explanation Text**: "Choose which cryptocurrencies your customers can use to pay"

### Step 4: Payout Setup üè¶

**Goal**: Configure where payments go

- **Streamlined Wallet Flow**:
  - Show existing wallets as cards with network badges
  - "Add New Wallet" as secondary option
  - Auto-detect network compatibility with payment methods
- **Network Validation**: Prevent mismatched wallet/payment networks
- **Quick Setup**: "Use my connected wallet" option for Web3 users

### Step 5: Review & Create ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Final review and confirmation

- **Complete Preview**: Show exactly what customers will see
- **Edit Links**: Quick access to modify any section
- **Pricing Calculator**: Show example subscription costs over time
- **Creation Confirmation**: Success state with next steps
