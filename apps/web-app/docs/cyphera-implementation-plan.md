6. **Loading States** - Comprehensive skeleton loaders and loading components
7. **React Query Caching** - Intelligent cache durations based on data types
8. **Session Management Consolidation** - UnifiedSessionService for both merchant/customer sessions
9. **Reusable HOCs** - withAuth, withErrorBoundary, withLoading, withSuspense, withFeatures
10. **Zustand State Management** - Core stores created (auth, wallet, network, ui)
11. **Performance Optimizations** - Bundle analyzer, lazy loading, library optimizations, Next.js config
12. **Context to Zustand Migration** - Completed migration from Context API to Zustand stores
13. **Hook Architecture** - Domain-specific hooks for auth, networks, wallets, transactions, subscriptions

2. **ESLint Build Checking** - Currently set to `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` (should be false)
3. **TODO Comments** - 8 TODO comments found across the codebase
4. **Security Hardening** - Not yet implemented (httpOnly cookies, CSRF, rate limiting)

## Next Priority Tasks üéØ

Based on current state analysis, here are the logical next steps:

### Option 1: ~~Complete Zustand Migration~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [ ] Enable ESLint during builds (`ignoreDuringBuilds: false`)
- [ ] Add Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Set up Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Add commitlint for conventional commits
- [ ] Configure Prettier with team standards

**Effort**: 1-2 days | **Impact**: Medium | **Difficulty**: Easy

### Option 6: Clean Up Remaining Issues üßπ
**Why**: Quick wins to improve code quality.

- [ ] Remove remaining 21 console.log statements
- [ ] Address 8 TODO comments
- [ ] Remove debug endpoints
- [ ] Fix remaining ESLint warnings
- [ ] Update deprecated dependencies

**Effort**: 1 day | **Impact**: Low | **Difficulty**: Very Easy

## Detailed Implementation Plans

### Complete Zustand Migration (Option 1)

**Current State Analysis:**
- Zustand stores exist but aren't fully utilized
- Multiple contexts still in use (AuthContext, NetworkContext, etc.)
- Components still use prop drilling
- No state persistence implemented

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Day 1: Core Migration**
   - Replace AuthContext usage with useAuthStore
   - Replace NetworkContext usage with useNetworkStore
   - Update all components to use store hooks instead of contexts

2. **Day 2: Component Refactoring**
   - Remove prop drilling from CreateProductMultiStepDialog
   - Simplify wallet selection components
   - Consolidate network switching logic

3. **Day 3: Persistence & Cleanup**
   - Add persistence middleware for user preferences
   - Remove old Context providers
   - Add Zustand devtools
   - Update provider hierarchy in app layout

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero Context providers (except necessary React Query)
- No prop drilling in complex components
- User preferences persist across sessions
- Improved component render performance

### Security Hardening (Option 2)

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **httpOnly Cookies**
```typescript
// Update session handling
cookies().set('session', token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'lax',
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 7 days
});
```

2. **CSRF Protection**
```typescript
import { csrf } from 'next-csrf';

const { withCsrf } = csrf({
  secret: process.env.CSRF_SECRET,
});

export default withCsrf(handler);
```

3. **Rate Limiting**
```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});
```
