# Smart Account Deployment Verification Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds smart account deployment verification to ensure customers deploy their smart accounts on-chain before creating subscriptions. This is a one-time requirement that enables the smart account to function properly for EIP-7715 permissions and subscription payments.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Deployment Verification Utility (`src/lib/web3/utils/smart-account-deployment.ts`)

**Functions:**

- `isSmartAccountDeployed(address, publicClient)` - Checks if bytecode exists at the smart account address
- `deploySmartAccount(smartAccount)` - Deploys the smart account using the MetaMask toolkit's deploy method

**Key Features:**

- Uses `getBytecode()` to verify contract deployment
- Returns `true` if bytecode exists and is not empty
- Handles errors gracefully with proper logging

### 2. Enhanced Hook (`src/lib/web3/hooks/useWalletPermissions.ts`)

**New State Properties:**

- `isDeployed: boolean | null` - Deployment status (null = checking, true = deployed, false = not deployed)
- `isCheckingDeployment: boolean` - Loading state for deployment check
- `isDeploying: boolean` - Loading state for deployment transaction

**New Functions:**

- `deploySmartAccount()` - Deploys the smart account and updates state
- `checkDeploymentStatus()` - Checks deployment status and updates state
- Automatic deployment checking when smart account address changes

**Workflow:**

1. Create smart account (generates counterfactual address)
2. Check deployment status automatically
3. Allow user to deploy if not deployed
4. Update status after successful deployment

### 3. Updated UI Components

#### ProductPaymentCard (`src/components/public/product-payment-card.tsx`)

- Shows deployment status with badges (Deployed/Not Deployed/Checking...)
- Displays deployment warning section for undeployed accounts
- Provides deployment button with loading states
- Only enables subscription when account is deployed

#### DelegationButton (`src/components/public/delegation-button.tsx`)

- Checks deployment status before requesting permissions
- Automatically deploys account if needed during subscription flow
- Updated button states and tooltips for deployment steps
- Enhanced error handling for deployment failures

### 4. User Experience Flow

**Complete User Journey:**

1. **Connect Wallet** - User connects MetaMask
2. **Create Smart Account** - System creates smart account instance (automatic)
3. **Check Deployment** - System checks if account is deployed on-chain (automatic)
4. **Deploy Account** - User deploys account if needed (one-time transaction)
5. **Subscribe** - User can now create subscriptions with EIP-7715 permissions

**Deployment States:**

- `null` - Checking deployment status
- `false` - Account not deployed (show deploy button)
- `true` - Account deployed (enable subscription)

### 5. Error Handling

**Deployment Errors:**

- User rejection of deployment transaction
- Network errors during deployment
- Insufficient gas for deployment
- Smart account instance not available

**Deployment Check Errors:**

- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid smart account address
- Public client not available

## Benefits

1. **Security** - Ensures smart accounts are properly deployed before use
2. **User Clarity** - Clear visual indicators of deployment status
3. **Automatic Flow** - Seamless integration into existing subscription flow
4. **One-time Cost** - Users only pay deployment cost once per account
5. **Error Recovery** - Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

## Technical Notes

- Deployment checking uses `getBytecode()` from viem
- All state updates are properly managed with React hooks
- Loading states provide clear user feedback
- Deployment is integrated into the subscription flow
- Compatible with existing EIP-7715 permission system

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/web3/utils/smart-account-deployment.ts` (new)
2. `src/lib/web3/hooks/useSmartAccount.ts` â†’ `src/lib/web3/hooks/useWalletPermissions.ts`
3. `src/components/public/product-payment-card.tsx`
4. `src/components/public/delegation-button.tsx`
5. `src/components/public/usdc-balance-card.tsx`

## Future Enhancements

- Add deployment cost estimation
- Support for different deployment gas strategies
- Batch deployment for multiple smart accounts
- Deployment transaction tracking and confirmation
