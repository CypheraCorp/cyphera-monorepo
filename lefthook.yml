# Configuration for Lefthook Git hooks manager
# https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook

# Lefthook will skip all hooks if the LEFTHOOK=0 environment variable is set

# List of files/patterns to exclude from all hooks
# exclude:
#   - "**/vendor/**"

# Hooks configuration
pre-commit:
  # The 'commands' list contains commands to run for this hook
  commands:
    # Define a command named 'lint'
    lint:
      # Glob pattern to match files the command should run on.
      # Using "*.go" restricts it to Go files only.
      # If you wanted to run on *all* committed files, you might omit 'glob'.
      glob: "*.go"
      # The command to execute. {staged_files} is a placeholder replaced
      # by Lefthook with the list of staged files matching the glob.
      # Using {staged_files} is generally faster than running on all files.
      # run: golangci-lint run {staged_files}
      #
      # Alternatively, run on all files in the project if linting only
      # staged files causes issues or isn't desired:
      run: golangci-lint run ./...
